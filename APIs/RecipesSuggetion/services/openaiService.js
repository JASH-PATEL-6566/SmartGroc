I have the following food items: ${ingredientList}.
Also assume I have all common vegetables, spices, oil, salt, etc.

Based on this, suggest multiple recipes. For each recipe, return a JSON object with:
- name (e.g., "Cheesy Pizza", "Tomato Pasta", "Spicy Chickpea Snack", etc.)
- brand (e.g., "Quick Recipe", "Home Recipe", "Easy Dinner", etc.)
- description (a short summary about the dish, its flavor, and when it can be enjoyed)
- ingredients_required (list of objects, each with "name" and "isPresent" (true/false based on whether the ingredient is present in the input list))
- instructions (list of strings)(detailed, step-by-step instructions for each stage of preparation and cooking)
- time_to_make (e.g., "20 minutes")
- estimated_calories (number)
- imageUrl (direct link to an image of the final dish make sure it is working)
- match_percent (percentage of the ingredients user has compared to the ingredients required for the recipe)

Please ensure the recipes are based on the ingredients provided and can be easily made. Respond strictly in JSON array format as shown in the example below:
